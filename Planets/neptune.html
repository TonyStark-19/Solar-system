                <h1 class="planet-name">Neptune: The Windy Planet</h1>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, known for its deep blue color and powerful
                    storms. It is a gas giant with a composition similar to Uranus, and it is renowned for having the
                    strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph).</p>

                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~4.5 billion km (2.8 billion miles)</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Neptune is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen (80%) and helium (19%), with traces of
                    methane, which gives the planet its signature blue color. Like Uranus, Neptune has a deep
                    atmosphere of icy materials such as water, ammonia, and methane. Neptune's surface is not solid, and
                    its atmosphere contains dark, stormy clouds and high winds.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Neptune’s atmosphere contains clouds of methane, ethane, and diacetylene. The planet
                    experiences the most intense winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching 2,100 km/h (1,300
                    mph), which is eight times the speed of sound. Neptune also has large storm systems, including
                    the Great Dark Spot, which is similar to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot but is transient and can
                    disappear and reappear.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Neptune orbits the Sun at 5.4 km/s (3.4 miles/s) and takes 165 Earth years to complete one
                    orbit. A day on Neptune lasts about 16.1 hours. Due to its position in the outer solar system,
                    Neptune has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. The planet's atmosphere also exhibits
                    super-rotation, where the upper clouds move faster than the planet's actual rotation.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Neptune has been explored primarily by NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, which passed by the planet in
                    1989. The spacecraft provided invaluable data about Neptune’s atmosphere, rings, and moons. One of
                    its moons, Triton, is unique because it has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it may have
                    been captured by Neptune's gravity. Future missions are being considered to further explore this
                    distant planet and its moons.</p>

                    <h3>Fun Facts About Neptune:</h3>
                </div>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most interesting due to
                        its retrograde orbit and geysers that spew nitrogen gas.</li>
                    <li>Despite being farther from the Sun, Neptune’s internal heat is greater than that of Uranus,
                        making it warmer than expected for its distance.</li>
                    <li>Neptune has six rings, but they are very faint and not as prominent as Saturn's rings.</li>
                    <li>Neptune’s winds are the strongest in the solar system, with gusts reaching 2,100 km/h
                        (1,300 mph).</li>
