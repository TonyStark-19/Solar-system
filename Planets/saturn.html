                <h1 class="planet-name">Saturn: The Ringed Planet</h1>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is best known for its spectacular ring system. As a gas
                    giant, Saturn has captivated astronomers for centuries with its size, rings, and numerous moons. It
                    is the second-largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter.</p>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Saturn is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen (96%) and helium (3%), with traces of
                    methane, ammonia, and other gases. It has no solid surface, but its lower atmosphere is made up of
                    clouds of liquid hydrogen and helium. Saturn is most famous for its beautiful and extensive ring
                    system, made primarily of ice and rock particles.</p>

                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Saturn’s atmosphere is composed of layers of clouds, with different colors and temperatures at
                    various altitudes. The uppermost clouds are made of ammonia ice, while the lower clouds are composed
                    of water vapor and methane. Saturn has high-speed winds, reaching up to 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph)
                    at the equator, and experiences extreme temperature variations.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Saturn orbits the Sun at 9.7 km/s (6.0 miles/s). Despite its massive size, a day on Saturn
                    lasts only about 10.7 hours, and it completes a year in 29.5 Earth years. The planet’s rapid
                    rotation causes it to flatten slightly at the poles, giving it an oblate shape.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Saturn has been explored by several spacecraft, most notably NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which
                    orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, providing invaluable data about the planet, its rings, and moons.
                    Cassini also discovered water plumes erupting from the moon Enceladus, indicating the
                    potential for life. Future missions may continue to explore Saturn’s moons, especially Titan,
                    which has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.</p>

                </div>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Saturn’s rings are made mostly of ice particles, some as small as dust grains and others
                        as large as mountains.</li>
                    <li>Saturn has at least 82 moons, including the largest, Titan, which is larger than Mercury
                        and has a thick atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Despite its size, Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system; it could float in water
                        if a body of water were large enough!</li>
                    <li>Saturn has storms that can last for months, including a massive storm at its north pole
                        known as the hexagon storm.</li>
                </ul>
