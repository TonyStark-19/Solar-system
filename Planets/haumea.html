                <h1 class="planet-name">Haumea: The Fast-Spinning Dwarf Planet</h1>
                <p>Haumea is a dwarf planet located in the **Kuiper Belt**, beyond Neptune. It is known for its
                    **elongated shape** and **rapid rotation**, which makes it unique among the dwarf planets.
                    Discovered in 2004, Haumea is named after the **Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth**.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~6.43 billion km (4 billion miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: ~2,000 km (1,240 miles) along its longest axis</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: ~3.9 hours (one of the shortest in the solar system)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: ~285 Earth years</li>
                    <li>Gravity: ~0.44 times Earth's gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature Range: ~-241°C (-402°F)</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Haumea has an **elongated, oval shape** due to its **fast rotation**. Its surface is primarily
                    composed of **water ice**, making it one of the brightest objects in the Kuiper Belt. Scientists
                    believe that Haumea might have experienced a **large collision in the past**, which could have given
                    it its unique shape and fast spin.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Haumea has **no significant atmosphere**, meaning it experiences extreme cold temperatures. Its
                    surface is mostly frozen, and due to its **high reflectivity**, it does not retain much heat.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Haumea orbits the Sun at **4.5 km/s (2.8 miles/s)**. It has one of the **shortest days** of any known
                    large object in the solar system, rotating in just **3.9 hours**. This rapid spin is responsible for
                    its **stretched, rugby-ball shape**.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>No spacecraft have visited Haumea yet. However, observations from the **Hubble Space Telescope** and
                    **ground-based telescopes** have provided insights into its size, shape, and composition. A future
                    mission could reveal more details about this mysterious dwarf planet.</p>

                    <li>Haumea was officially recognized as a **dwarf planet in 2008**.</li>
                    <li>It has **two known moons**, named **Hiʻiaka** and **Namaka**, after Hawaiian deities.</li>
                    <li>Haumea is the **fastest-spinning** large object in the solar system.</li>
