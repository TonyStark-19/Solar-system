                <h1 class="planet-name">Uranus: The Ice Giant</h1>
                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its unique sideways rotation. It is an ice
                    giant with a composition primarily made of water, ammonia, and methane ices. Uranus stands out in
                    the solar system due to its tilted axis, which causes extreme seasons.</p>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Uranus is an ice giant and, like other gas giants, does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere is
                    composed mainly of hydrogen (83%) and helium (15%), with traces of methane, which gives it
                    its blue-green color. The planet is mostly made up of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane,
                    which form its deep, cold atmosphere.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Uranus has a cold, icy atmosphere dominated by methane, which absorbs red light and gives the
                    planet its characteristic blue hue. Winds can reach speeds of up to 900 km/h (560 mph), and the
                    planet experiences extreme seasonal changes due to its extreme axial tilt. One pole faces the
                    Sun for 42 years at a time, while the other remains in darkness for the same period.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Uranus orbits the Sun at 6.8 km/s (4.2 miles/s), and its day lasts about 17.2 hours. The
                    planet’s most unique feature is its tilted axis, which is tilted by about 98°, meaning that it
                    essentially rolls on its side as it orbits the Sun. This tilt results in dramatic seasonal
                    variations.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Uranus has been explored by NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew by the planet in 1986 and
                    provided the most detailed data about Uranus to date. Voyager 2 revealed details about its
                    atmosphere, rings, and moons. Uranus has 13 rings and 27 moons, with some, like Miranda,
                    exhibiting dramatic geological features.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Uranus has a very tilted axis, which makes it the only planet in the solar system that
                        rotates on its side.</li>
                    <li>It has 13 known rings, though they are very faint compared to Saturn's rings.</li>
                    <li>Uranus is the coldest planet in the solar system, with temperatures dropping to -224°C
                        (-371°F).</li>
                    <li>Uranus’s moon Miranda has some of the most extreme geological features in the solar system,
                        including huge canyons and ice cliffs.</li>
                </ul>
