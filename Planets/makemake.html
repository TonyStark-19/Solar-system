                <h1 class="planet-name">Makemake: The Elusive Dwarf Planet</h1>
                <p>Makemake is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy
                    bodies. It is one of the largest known dwarf planets and was discovered in 2005. Makemake is named
                    after the creation deity of the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island.</p>

                    <h3>Key Facts About Makemake:</h3>
                </div>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~6.85 billion km (4.25 billion miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: ~1,430 km (890 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: ~22.5 hours</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: ~305 Earth years</li>
                    <li>Gravity: ~0.05 times Earth's gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature Range: -240°C (-400°F)</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Makemake has a bright, icy surface primarily made of methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen
                    ice. Its reddish hue is similar to Pluto’s, but it lacks a significant atmosphere. Observations
                    suggest its surface may be covered in frozen methane, giving it a reflective appearance.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Unlike Pluto, Makemake does not appear to have a significant atmosphere. However, some scientists
                    believe that it may develop a temporary atmosphere when it gets closer to the Sun, as frozen gases
                    sublimate. Its surface remains extremely cold, with temperatures reaching as low as -240°C.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Makemake orbits the Sun at an average speed of 4.4 km/s (2.7 miles/s). A day on Makemake
                    lasts about 22.5 hours, making its rotation similar to Earth’s. However, its year is about 305
                    Earth years long, meaning it takes a very long time to complete one orbit around the Sun.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Makemake has not yet been visited by any spacecraft. Most of what we know about this dwarf planet
                    comes from telescopic observations, including those made by the Hubble Space Telescope. Future
                    missions could provide more details about its surface and composition.</p>
