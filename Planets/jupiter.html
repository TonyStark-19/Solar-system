                <h1 class="planet-name">Jupiter: The Gas Giant</h1>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest planet in our solar system. Known for its
                    massive size and distinct Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth, Jupiter has been a subject of
                    fascination for scientists and space enthusiasts alike.</p>

                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~778.3 million km (484 million miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: 139,820 km (86,881 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: 9.9 hours</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Jupiter is a gas giant and does not have a solid surface like Earth. Its atmosphere is primarily
                    composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a massive storm system, the Great Red Spot, and is home
                    to many moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.</p>

                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Jupiter's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen (90%) and helium (10%), with traces of
                    methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The atmosphere is characterized by cloud bands in varying colors
                    and turbulent storm systems. The planet has extremely high wind speeds and experiences temperature
                    extremes.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Jupiter orbits the Sun at 13.1 km/s (8.1 miles/s). A day on Jupiter is extremely short,
                    lasting only about 9.9 hours, making it the fastest rotating planet in the solar system. Despite its
                    rapid rotation, a Jupiter year lasts almost 12 Earth years.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Jupiter has been explored by numerous spacecraft, including NASA’s Juno mission, which is
                    currently studying the planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. The Galileo spacecraft also
                    studied Jupiter and its moons for several years. Future missions may explore its moons, especially
                    Europa, which may harbor liquid water beneath its icy surface.</p>
