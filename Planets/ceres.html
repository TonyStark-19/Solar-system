                <h1 class="planet-name">Ceres: The Largest Object in the Asteroid Belt</h1>
                <p>Ceres is the smallest dwarf planet and the largest object in the asteroid belt, located
                    between Mars and Jupiter. It was the first asteroid ever discovered in 1801 and was later
                    classified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Ceres is unique because it contains water ice, raising
                    the possibility of subsurface liquid water and even microbial life.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~414 million km (257 million miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: ~946 km (587 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: ~9.1 hours</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: ~4.6 Earth years</li>
                    <li>Gravity: ~0.03 times Earth’s gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature Range: ~-106°C to -38°C (-159°F to -36°F)</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Ceres has a rocky core with a thick layer of water ice. The surface contains hydrated
                    minerals, clays, and carbon-rich compounds. Scientists believe that beneath its icy crust, a
                    subsurface ocean may exist, making it a potential target in the search for extraterrestrial life.

                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Ceres has a thin, transient atmosphere mainly composed of water vapor, likely released from
                    cryovolcanic activity or sublimation of surface ice. Unlike other dwarf planets, it is located
                    in the inner solar system, making it much warmer than Pluto or Eris.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Ceres orbits the Sun at an average speed of 17.9 km/s (11.1 miles/s). It has a fast rotation,
                    completing one full spin in just 9 hours, making its day much shorter than Earth’s.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Ceres was visited by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft in 2015, making it the first dwarf planet ever
                    orbited by a spacecraft. Dawn discovered bright salt deposits in its Occator Crater,
                    indicating past geological activity.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Ceres is the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, unlike Pluto, Eris, and Haumea, which
                        are in the Kuiper Belt or beyond.</li>
                    <li>It may contain more water than Earth’s fresh water supply in the form of ice.</li>
                    <li>The bright spots on Ceres, especially in Occator Crater, are believed to be salt deposits
                        from evaporated briny water.</li>
                    <li>Ceres was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture and harvest.</li>
