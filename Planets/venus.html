                <h1 class="planet-name">Venus: Earth's Mysterious Twin</h1>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size and
                    composition. However, its thick, toxic atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the
                    hottest planet in our solar system.</p>

                    <h3>Key Facts About Venus:</h3>
                </div>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~108.2 million km (67.24 million miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: 12,104 km (7,521 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: 243 Earth days (longer than its year!)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: 225 Earth days</li>
                    <li>Gravity: 0.91 times Earth's gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature: ~467°C (872°F) on average</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Venus has a rocky surface covered with vast plains, volcanoes, and craters. It has the most volcanoes
                    of any planet, with over 1,600 major volcanic structures. The planet’s surface is extremely dry,
                    with no liquid water.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Venus’ thick atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This
                    traps heat in an extreme greenhouse effect, making Venus even hotter than Mercury. Its atmospheric
                    pressure is 92 times that of Earth’s, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater!</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Venus orbits the Sun at 35.02 km/s (21.76 miles/s). It has a retrograde rotation, meaning it
                    spins in the opposite direction compared to most planets. A single day on Venus lasts longer than
                    its year!</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Venus has been explored by multiple missions, including NASA’s Magellan, the Soviet Venera
                    landers, and more recently, ESA’s Venus Express. Upcoming missions like NASA’s VERITAS and
                    ESA’s EnVision aim to uncover more about its geology and atmosphere.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Venus is the brightest planet in our sky and can sometimes be seen during daylight.</li>
                    <li>It has no moons or rings, like Mercury.</li>
                    <li>Venus is the only planet named after a female deity, the Roman goddess of love.</li>
                    <li>It has the slowest rotation of any planet and rotates backward compared to Earth.</li>
