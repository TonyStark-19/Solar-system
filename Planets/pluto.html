                <h1 class="planet-name">Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</h1>
                <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy
                    bodies. Once classified as the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the
                    International Astronomical Union. Despite its small size, Pluto remains one of the most intriguing
                    objects in the solar system.</p>

                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~5.9 billion km (3.7 billion miles)</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Pluto’s surface is a mix of frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. It also has large
                    plains of frozen methane and ice mountains, some reaching heights of up to 3,500 meters. The
                    Tombaugh Regio, a large, heart-shaped glacier, is one of the most well-known features on Pluto.
                    Its surface is also characterized by vast plains, icy mountains, and deep craters.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Pluto has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and
                    carbon monoxide. The atmosphere is incredibly cold, and it undergoes seasonal changes as Pluto
                    moves through its orbit. During its closest approach to the Sun, Pluto's atmosphere temporarily
                    thickens as the ice on its surface sublimates into gas, but it freezes again as Pluto moves farther
                    away.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Pluto orbits the Sun at an average speed of 4.7 km/s (2.9 miles/s). A day on Pluto lasts
                    about 6.4 Earth days, while its year lasts about 248 Earth years. Pluto’s orbit is highly
                    elliptical, meaning its distance from the Sun changes dramatically. It takes Pluto about 20 years to
                    move closer to the Sun and 20 years to move farther away in its orbit.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Pluto was explored in 2015 by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, which provided the first detailed
                    images and data of the dwarf planet. The spacecraft revealed surprising features on Pluto’s surface,
                    including the Tombaugh Regio, large icy plains, and possible cryovolcanoes. New Horizons also
                    provided the first data on Pluto’s thin atmosphere and its interaction with solar wind.</p>

                </div>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest. The Pluto-Charon system is
                        sometimes considered a double dwarf planet because the two bodies orbit a common center of mass
                        outside Pluto.</li>
                    <li>Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, and it was the ninth planet until it was
                        reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.</li>
                    <li>Pluto has the most elliptical orbit of any planet or dwarf planet in the solar system, which
                        sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune.</li>
                    <li>The heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio was named after Pluto’s discoverer and is one of Pluto’s
                        most recognizable features.</li>
