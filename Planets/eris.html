                <h1 class="planet-name">Eris: The Most Massive Dwarf Planet</h1>
                <p>Eris is one of the largest known dwarf planets in the solar system, located in the scattered
                    disc region beyond the Kuiper Belt. Discovered in 2005, Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto but
                    more massive, making it an important object in planetary classification debates. It is named
                    after the Greek goddess of discord and strife.</p>

                    <h3>Key Facts About Eris:</h3>
                </div>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~10.1 billion km (6.3 billion miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: ~2,326 km (1,445 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: ~25.9 hours</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: ~557 Earth years</li>
                    <li>Gravity: ~0.82 times Pluto’s gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature Range: ~-243°C (-405°F)</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Eris has a highly reflective surface, indicating that it is covered with frozen methane and
                    nitrogen ice. Due to its extreme distance from the Sun, Eris remains one of the coldest known
                    objects in the solar system.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Eris has an extremely thin atmosphere, which likely collapses and freezes onto the surface when
                    it moves further from the Sun. When it gets slightly closer, some of this frozen material may
                    sublimate, forming a temporary atmosphere.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Eris orbits the Sun at an average speed of 3.4 km/s (2.1 miles/s). Its orbit is highly
                    elliptical and takes it far beyond Pluto’s orbit for much of its journey around the Sun.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>While no spacecraft has visited Eris yet, it has been studied extensively using telescopes, including
                    the Hubble Space Telescope. Due to its distance and slow orbit, it remains one of the least
                    explored large objects in the solar system.</p>

                    <h3>Fun Facts About Eris:</h3>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Eris was responsible for Pluto’s reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006.</li>
                    <li>It has one known moon, Dysnomia, named after the Greek spirit of lawlessness.</li>
                    <li>It is the second-largest known dwarf planet after Pluto but has more mass than Pluto.
                    </li>
                    <li>Eris takes over half a millennium to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
