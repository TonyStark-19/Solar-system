                </div>

                <p>Earth’s surface is covered 70% by water and 30% by land, featuring mountains, valleys,
                    deserts, and forests. Its core is mostly iron and nickel, surrounded by a dynamic mantle and crust.

                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Earth’s atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and traces of other gases. This balance allows
                    for life to thrive, protects from harmful radiation, and regulates temperature.</p>
