                <h1 class="planet-name">Mercury: The Swiftest Planet</h1>
                <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system. It is a rocky,
                    terrestrial planet with an extremely thin atmosphere, making it vulnerable to extreme temperature
                    variations.</p>

                    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~57.9 million km (35.98 million miles)</li>
                    <li>Diameter: 4,880 km (3,032 miles)</li>
                    <li>Length of a Day: 59 Earth days</li>
                    <li>Length of a Year: 88 Earth days</li>
                    <li>Gravity: 0.38 times Earth's gravity</li>
                    <li>Temperature Range: -173°C to 427°C (-280°F to 800°F)</li>

                    <h3>Surface and Composition:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Mercury’s surface is covered with craters, much like our Moon, due to frequent asteroid impacts. The
                    planet has a solid iron core, which is about 85% of its radius, making it the most metallic planet
                    in the solar system.</p>

                <div class="heading">
                    <h3>Atmosphere and Climate:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, or exosphere, composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, and
                    helium. Because of this, it cannot retain heat, resulting in extreme temperature shifts between day
                    and night.</p>

                    <h3>Orbital Speed and Rotation:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Mercury moves at a blazing speed of 47.87 km/s (29.74 miles/s), making it the fastest orbiting planet
                    in the solar system. Despite its short year, a single day on Mercury lasts about 176 Earth days due
                    to its slow rotation.</p>

                    <h3>Exploration:</h3>
                </div>

                <p>NASA’s Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions provided valuable data about Mercury’s surface and magnetic
                    field. In 2018, the BepiColombo mission (a joint project between the European Space Agency and JAXA)
                    was launched to study the planet further.</p>

                    <li>Mercury has no moons or rings.</li>
                    <li>It experiences solar days longer than its own year.</li>
                    <li>Its orbit is highly elliptical, making its speed vary dramatically.</li>
                    <li>Despite being close to the Sun, Venus is hotter than Mercury due to its thick atmosphere.</li>
